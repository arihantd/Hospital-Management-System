# Hospital-Management-System
(1.)	INTRODUCTION TO THE PROJECT
Hospital management system is a computer system that helps manage the information related to health care and aids in the job completion of health care providers effectively. 
HMS came into the picture of hospital management as early as 1960 and have ever since been evolving and synchronizing with the technologies while modernizing healthcare facilities. In today’s world, the management of healthcare starts from the hands of the patients through their mobile phones and facilitates the needs of the patient.

•	Maintain the medical records of the patient  
•	Maintain the contact details of the patient
•	Keep track of the appointment dates
The advantages of HMS can be pinpointed to the following:

•	Time-saving Technology
•	Improved Efficiency by avoiding human errors
•	Reduces scope for Error
•	Data security and correct data retrieval made possible
•	Cost effective and easily manageable
•	Easy access to patient data with correct patient history
•	Improved patient care made possible
•	Easy monitoring of supplies in inventory
•	Reduces the work of documentation
•	Better Audit controls and policy compliance.



Hospital Management System in Python
The hospital management system in python which we are going to build will look something like this:
 
Project Prerequisites
tkinter – Please run below command to install tkinter
pip install tkinter
pillow – Please run below command to install tkinter
pip install pillow
pymysql – Please run below command to install tkinter
pip install pymysql
Note: You are required to have MySQL server installed on your system in order to make pymysql work. If you do not have it ready, please download from MySQL Official website


Description of Project Files
Below are the project files you will get once you download and extract the HMS project:
•	patient.py– which does function call to all other python files
•	Hospital images – Hospital images for the UI

Description of Tables
Create Tables and the Database
 



 





Working Discription
This program consists of 6 options:
•	Add record of the patients
•	Update records
•	Reset the Reacords
•	Delete the records
•	Display all the records
•	Exit 
This is CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) application.
CRUD is an acronym that comes from the world of computer programming and refers to the four functions that are considered necessary to implement a persistent storage application: create, read, update and delete. The CRUD acronym identifies all of the major functions that are inherent to relational databases and the applications used to manage them, which include Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and others.
 
Here I am using the Mysql databases for the data management.

DATABASE
Here I am using the MySQL relation databases for the Data management of the Patients.
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system that works on many platforms. It provides multi-user access to support many storage engines and is backed by Oracle.
 
I am using MySQL with Python, for this project.
Python = Front End
MySQL = BackEnd
