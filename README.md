### DATABASE

Here I am using the MySQL relation databases for the Data management of the Patients.
I am using MySQL with Python, for this project.
#### Why MySQL?
Many of the world's largest and fastest-growing organizations including Facebook, Google, Adobe, Alcatel Lucent and Zappos rely on MySQL to save time and money powering their high-volume Web sites, business-critical systems and packaged software.


Below you will find valuable resources including case studies and white papers that will help you implement cost-effective database solutions using MySQL.
